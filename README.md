# What I Learned
This project was my first full-stack web application with Node.js. It really helped in making sure I knew how to build a backend that serves dynamic web pages to the user, and reinforced my ability to use popular frameworks and modules to acomplish certain tasks. For example, I learned mongoose to handle MongoDB functionality, and Passport.js / bcrypt.js to handle user autentication. Deploying this application on Heroku was my first time diving into setting up a live full-stack application.
